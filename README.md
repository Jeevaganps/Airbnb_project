# Airbnb_Analysis


## Problem Statement
Airbnb delves into a comprehensive exploration of Airbnb data. Airbnb has revolutionized the travel and property management industry, making it crucial to analyze its data to gain insights into pricing, availability patterns, and location-based trends. This project employs MongoDB Atlas, Streamlit, and data visualization techniques to provide an in-depth analysis.

## Prerequisites
- `Python` programming language
- `plotly` library
- `mongo atlas`
- `streamlit` library

  install the required libraries using pip:
   ```
   pip install streamlit_option_menu
   pip install plotly
   pip install streamlit
   pip install pandas
   ```

## How to run the application?
To run the Streamlit app, use the following command:

  ```
   streamlit run your_filename.py 
   ```

## Work Flow
- Retrive Airbnb Data from MongoDb Atlas
- Clean the data by removing duplicates
- Use Streamlit to visualize data
- Analyze and visualize how prices vary across different locations, property types, and seasons by creating dynamic plots and charts
- Investigate how the price of listings varies across different locations by using interactive maps
